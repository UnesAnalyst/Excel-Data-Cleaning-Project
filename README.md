# Excel-Data-Cleaning-Project
This is an Excel data cleaning project where I take Nashville_Housing_Data.xlsx file and clean it to get at the end a cleaned file (Cleaned_Nashville_Housing_ Data).
A log file is included (Cleaning_process_Nashville) too, where you can track the cleaning process step by step in details.
